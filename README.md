Config
======

This is a simple configuration repository intended for use when configuring new
machines, for example on Amazon AWS. It assumes that the configuring user has
admin privileges (ie. the user can use the sudo command).

To begin configuration, use
    curl -L https://github.com/JayThomason/config/begin.sh | sh
